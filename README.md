# Pet Store

This project is a simple HTML-based web page for a fictional pet store.  The Pet Store project allows users to explore different sections of a pet store website, including available pets, supplies, services, and contact information.

## Project Objectives

This project aims to provide hands-on experience with the following HTML concepts:

### 1. Understanding Basic HTML Document Structure
- Create a well-structured HTML document using essential tags like `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and `<title>`.
- Understand the role of each tag and how to organize content within an HTML page.

### 2. Using Headings and Paragraphs
- Use heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to define the main page title and section headers (e.g., "Welcome to Our Pet Store", "Available Pets", "Pet Supplies").
- Use paragraph tags (`<p>`) to add descriptions about the store, different pet categories, and services offered (e.g., grooming, veterinary care).

### 3. Inserting Images
- Insert images of pets, supplies, or store logos using the `<img>` tag.
- Use attributes like `src`, `alt`, and `title` to enhance accessibility and improve SEO.

### 4. Creating Links
- Add internal links to navigate between different sections of the page (e.g., linking to "About Us," "Contact Us," or "Shop" sections) using the `<a href="#section-id">` structure.
- Use external links to connect to related resources like pet care guides with `<a href="https://">`.

### 5. Building Lists
- Use ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists to organize content, such as a list of available pets (e.g., dogs, cats, birds) or a list of pet care tips.
- Implement list items using `<li>` tags.

### 6. Embedding Media (Optional for Audio/Video)
- Optionally embed media like pet care tutorial videos using the `<video>` tag or pet-related podcasts with the `<audio>` tag.

### 7. Creating Forms
- Design a basic form to collect user information, such as contacting the store, signing up for newsletters, or booking grooming appointments.
- Use elements like `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`, and `<select>` to create text fields, dropdowns, and buttons.

### 8. Using Semantic HTML
- Introduce semantic tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<article>` to structure the page in a meaningful way.
- Emphasize the importance of semantic HTML for improving accessibility and SEO.

### 9. Embedding a Google Map
- Embed a Google Map using an `<iframe>` to show the physical location of the pet store, helping customers who may want to visit in person.

### 10. Creating a Simple Table
- Use the `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>` elements to present information, such as pricing for pets or available services (e.g., grooming, training, veterinary care).
